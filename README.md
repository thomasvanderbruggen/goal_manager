# Goal Manager

A Flutter project designed to help me keep track of my goals and habits that I want to achieve and build. 

 The goal is: 
- Set a theme [Loosely based on this idea from CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE)
- Add goals that living to the theme will accomplish
- Set metrics to track those goals
- Add tasks that can have reminder notifications
- Journaling and note taking section
